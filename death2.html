    <h1 class="titulo">Rules</h1>
    <div class="regras">
        <ol>
            <li>This is the first and most important rule in Death Note. In order for someone to die through the notebook, their real name must be written on one of its sheets.</li>

            <li>The writing of the name will have no effect if the writer does not have the victim's face in mind.
            This way, people who share the same name will not be affected. That is, it is not enough just to know the name of the person you want to kill, but you also need to know their face and think about it while writing in the notebook.</li>

            <li>If the cause of death is not specified within 40 seconds, the person will die of cardiac arrest.
            Once the Death Note bearer performs the "ritual" of writing and thinking about the person he wants to kill, he must, within the next 40 seconds, explain the details of his death (such as the mode, time, place, etc.). If you don't, cardiac arrest will be the cause of death at the end of the 40 seconds.</li>

            <li>After the cause, details of death must be provided within the next 6 minutes and 40 seconds.
            After specifying the cause of death, the notebook holder has 6 minutes and 40 seconds to detail the entire scenario that will cause the death.</li>

            <li>Any kind of changes to the death details must also be made within this time limit. To do this, just cross out what has already been written with two straight lines and define a new cause.</li>

            <li>However, even changing the cause and time of death, it can never be avoided once the victim's name is written in the notebook.
                After this notebook touches the ground, it becomes the property of the human world.
                That is, a human cannot "take" a Death Note that has not been in contact with their world.
            The first person who touches the Death Note shortly after it arrives in the human world will automatically be its new owner.</li>

            <li>The notebook's owner will be able to see and hear the shinigami's original owner of the notebook.
            Each Death Note is associated with a specific God of Death. Thus, if a human becomes the owner of a Notebook, it must be able to communicate with the shinigami who previously possessed the artifact.</li>

            <li>The human who uses the notebook cannot go to Heaven or Hell.
            The fate of people who use the Death Note is the MU (the Void). This revelation was made by Ryuk to Light.</li>

            <li>Even though they are not the owner of the notebook, any human who touches it will be able to see and hear the shinigami following the current humanowner of the notebook.
            An example of this was when some members of the Japanese Task Force and L himself played the Death Note that was in the possession of Kyosuke Higuchi, known as Yotsuba Kira or Third Kira.</li>

            <li>From that moment on they were able to see and hear the shinigami Rem, the goddess of death who was accompanying the current owner of the notebook at the time.</li>

            <li>Other similar situations happen throughout the series, like when Mello's team meets the shinigami Sidoh, who came to the human world to retrieve his Death Note.
                A shinigami can extend their lifespan using the notebook, but humans cannot.
            In fact, this is the main purpose of the Shinigami using the Death Note. It was revealed by Ryuk that many gods of death even died because they were too lazy to write in their notebooks. In order to stay alive, shinigami MUST use the Death Note.</li>

            <li>A shinigami cannot be killed, even stabbed in the heart with a knife or shot in the head with a gun.
            When Sidoh appeared to Mello's gang, he was greeted with a shower of bullets, but they all went through the shinigami's body completely.</li>

            <li>However, not even the gods of death are immortal. It has been revealed throughout the series some ways that lead shinigami to death. In fact, Kira took advantage of one of these conditions to kill the shinigami Rem!</li>

            <li>The human in possession of the Death Note can obtain the Shinigami Eyes, and with this power the human will be able to see names and life expectancies of other humans just by watching them.
            Without a doubt, the Eyes of Shinigami is a very useful power for those who are in possession of the Death Note and want to use it more freely. However, there is a price for everything...</li>

            <li>In order for the Eyes' deal to be made, the human owner of the Notebook must sacrifice half of their lifespan, offering it to the shinigami.</li>

            <li>However, if you lose ownership of the Death Note, the person who made the Eye Agreement does not regain life time, but no longer has the power received by the shinigami.</li>

            <li>The cause of death must be physically possible in every way.
            For example, writing that a certain person will be killed by a bus ON THE MOON within the next two hours. Obviously it would be impossible for that to happen, much less in such a short time.</li>

            <li>When there are inconsistencies in the specified cause of death, then the victim will simply die of a heart attack.
                A page extracted from Death Note, or even a fragment of the page, retains all the functionality of the notebook.
            Kira did this several times. He ripped pages from his notebook or even small pieces to carry with him more discreetly.</li>

            <li>Light even created a mechanism in his watch where he hid a small piece of paper from the Death Note and a needle. This last object was used to pierce his finger and use his own blood as ink to write on the sheet, in cases of extreme emergency.</li>
        </li>
        <li>This all also proves that it doesn't matter what kind of material you use to write in Death Note (ink, blood, makeup, etc). In fact, the important thing is that the written name is legible.</li>

        <li>The cause and details of death can be written before the name. The owner has 19 days (according to the human calendar) to put the name in front of the described cause.
        If you put a name after this period, the victim will die of a heart attack. The previously specified cause will be nullified.</li>

        <li>Even without possession, any human can write in the notebook and have the same effect.
            Kira has exploited this rule many times throughout the series. For example, even though he still owned the Notebook, Light lent it to Kiyomi Takada, his ex-girlfriend. Takada was a journalist and, with the help of Teru Mikami, the X-Kira, became the serial killer's spokesperson in the media.
            The Death Note has no effect on those under 780 days old.
            It's no use trying to kill children under 2 years old, because the Death Note has no effect - Good!
        </li>

        <li>Speaking of children, the Death Note should also not be given by a Shinigami to people under the age of 6. The exception is if the child finds the Death Note when it is released into the human world.</li>

        <li>The victim is immune to the notebook's effects if their name is unintentionally misspelled four times.
        Even if you spell it correctly the fifth time, the victim will no longer suffer from the Death Note's fate.</li>

        <li>If the writer intentionally misspells his victim's name four times, he will die and the victim will remain vulnerable to the notebook.
        Attention, only if the error was intentional!</li>

        <li>In the case of a person who has given up possession of their Death Note, coming into physical contact with another notebook will have their memories back as long as they maintain physical contact with the notebook.</li>

        <li>This happened when Light touched the Notebook that was in Yotsuba Kira's possession when the latter was captured by the Task Force. But, if he dropped the Death Note, he would lose memories related to the Notebook again.
            Committing suicide is a possible form of death. In principle, any human can think about committing suicide.
        This is a cause of death that Kira often uses to confuse the police, as well as interrupt the pattern of deaths from heart attacks.</li>

        <li>However, if the specification of suicide leads to the death of others, the victim will die of a heart attack. In this way, the Death Note ensures that other lives are not influenced.</li>

        <li>If the notebook is lost or stolen, the original owner will lose its possession if he does not retrieve it within 490 days.
        Remembering that the owner of the Notebook will only lose possession of it if he RENOTS the "position". If by chance you lose the Death Note and someone else finds it, without giving it up, the owner has 490 days to get the Notebook back.</li>

        <li>Otherwise, ownership passes to whoever has the Death Note, causing the former owner to lose all memories related to the artifact.</li>


        <li>There can only be 6 Death Notes simultaneously in the human world.
        In this case, if a seventh Death Note exists in the human world, it will be a simple ordinary notebook. The extra notebook will only start to take effect if one of the other 6 is destroyed.</li>

        So, according to this logic, a human being can own up to 6 different Death Notes!
